The dataset includes 1257 images.
Keyboard-mouse-laptop are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -35 and +35 percent
